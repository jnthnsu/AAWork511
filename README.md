# App Academy Online

App Academy Online is identical to App Academy's in-person full-time software engineering curriculum. It covers ~1500 hours of material including fundamentals such as data structures and algorithms, design patterns, scalability, OOP, TDD, computational complexity, and software engineering best practices. Programming languages and technologies include Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React-Redux, SQL, Git, HTML and CSS. 

The repo will be *FREQUENTLY* updated with my solutions to all the exercises and challenges from the curriculum.
